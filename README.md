# myQSA
An online record system allowing Explorer Scouts/Scout Network to track their progress with their [Queen's Scout Award](https://www.scouts.org.uk/top-awards/queens-scout-award/) (QSA). The system uses [Laravel](https://laravel.com) and [Laravel Jetstream](https://jetstream.laravel.com) (with [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com)) as a framework.

I am (for the most part) using [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) and [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org).
